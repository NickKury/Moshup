## What is Moshup?
Moshup is a full stack web application where users can create and join events to find other concert goers to attend with.

Useres can create, update, and delete events.  Other users can join or comment on these events.  

## Technologies Used
Moshup is a fullstack application.  The backend was built with Express and sequelize. The frontend was built using Javascript, React, and Redux. 


## Conclusion and Looking Forward
Building Moshup was a key experience for me.  It is the first fullstack project that I attempted on my own.  I learned what I am capable of and also where I need to continue improving.  I look forward to improving this application and to continue to create new projects.  

Looking Forward I plan to continue to flesh out further functionality like searching based on genere, more user interactions with one another,  and implementing a userpage to keep track of attending events and friends.
